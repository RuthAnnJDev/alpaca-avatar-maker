> **Note**: Some features like user sign-up, sign-in, and saving favorites only work when the app is run using a local server. See [How to Run Locally](#how-to-run-locally) below for full instructions.

## 🔧 Tech/Framework Used

Built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) – for image capture/download

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

To run this project on your own machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruthannjdev/alpaca-avatar-maker.git
   cd alpaca-avatar-maker
Open the project using a local development server:

If you're using Visual Studio Code, install the Live Server extension.

2. Open index.html in Live Server by right-clicking the file → Open with Live Server.

⚠️ Opening index.html directly in a browser (by double-clicking it) may result in broken features like sign-in/sign-up, because modern browsers block some functionality for local files.

3. 🎨 Customize, 🎲 randomize, 🧾 name, 💾 save favorites, and 📥 download your alpaca creation!
